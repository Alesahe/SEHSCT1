to-do:
- debug (below)
- accessibility considerations (in logbook)
- log about gantt chart and storyboard
- fix comments n references, clean up code
- record stuff

necessary bug fixes:
- test on different browsers (literally so much doesnt work on edge :sob:)
     - edge renders the potential search results width wrong

- fix burger menu (how to make it active and change colour as well?)
